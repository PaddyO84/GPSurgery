    <h2>Medical Certification / Sick Notes / Reports</h2>
    <p>If you need a sick note for work you may need to attend the surgery in person and be seen by a GP who can confirm and certify your note.</p>
    <p>If you have been an inpatient in Hospital, we will need a letter from the hospital confirming your stay before we can provide certification.</p>
    <p>If you have been absent from work for more than six days, you may need a continuance sick note such as a Social Welfare Certificate. We will need your PPS number and the dates of your sick leave. Please contact reception 48 hours before your social welfare certificate is due and they need to be collected from reception in person.</p>
    <p>Letters and reports requested by patients will incur a charge depending on the complexity of the condition.</p>
