    <h3>Repeat Prescriptions</h3>
    <p>Repeat prescriptions are available to patients without consultation once the medication has been agreed to by your GP and you have undergone an up-to-date medication review. If you wish to change your medication or dosage, please make an appointment to discuss this with your GP.</p>

    <h3>Where a consultation may be required</h3>
    <p>There are certain medications that can only be prescribed monthly and must be authorised by the attending GP. Examples include strong painkillers and sleeping tablets.</p>

    <h3>How often should I review my medication with my doctor?</h3>
    <p>If taking regular medications, you should review these at least every 12 months with your GP/Consultant to ensure you are on the best available medication for your condition. Some questions you may ask are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is this medication still meeting my health needs?</li>
        <li>Do I still need to take this/these medications?</li>
        <li>Is the medicine list on my record accurate?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are on a repeat prescription, this may need to be reviewed every 6-12 months (depending on your health condition and the medication involved) to ensure you are on the best available treatment for your condition.</p>
    <p>For patients with multi-morbidities (having a number of different ongoing medical conditions and often attending a number of clinics or specialists), you may be asked to attend for medication review at the practice more often.</p>
    <p class="fw-bold">48 Hours notice is required for all repeat prescriptions.</p>
