# Analysis of Future Hosting Options

This document outlines the potential paths for evolving the prescription request system from its current setup on GitHub Pages and Google Apps Script to a more robust, self-hosted web application.

---

## Current System (Baseline for Comparison)

*   **Front-End Hosting:** GitHub Pages
*   **Back-End Logic:** Google Apps Script
*   **Database:** Google Sheets
*   **Estimated Cost:** **$0 / month**
*   **Pros:**
    *   Completely free.
    *   Zero server maintenance required from you.
    *   Leverages the familiar Google ecosystem.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Tightly coupled to Google's services; cannot easily move.
    *   Google Sheets can become slow and difficult to manage with thousands of rows.
    *   Not a traditional, scalable web application architecture.
    *   Limited in implementing more advanced features (e.g., real-time communication, complex database queries).

## Option 1: Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Highly Recommended

A PaaS provider manages the underlying infrastructure (servers, operating systems, security patches), allowing you to focus only on your application's code. This is the ideal next step for a small clinic without a dedicated IT department.

### Key Providers:

#### 1. **Vercel** or **Netlify** (Best for Front-End Focus)
*   **Concept:** These platforms are industry leaders for deploying modern front-end web applications. They connect directly to a GitHub repository and deploy changes automatically. They can run simple back-end logic using "serverless functions."
*   **Best For:** Evolving the front-end form into a more powerful application while keeping the back-end logic simple. The current Google Apps Script could even be called from a serverless function.
*   **Complexity to Manage:** **Low.** The platform handles all the infrastructure.
*   **Estimated Cost:**
    *   **Free Tier:** Both have generous free "Hobby" tiers that are likely sufficient for the application's current scale. This includes a global CDN for fast loading times.
    *   **Paid Plans:** If you need more resources or team features, plans start at approximately **$20/month per user**.

#### 2. **Render** (Best for Back-End Flexibility)
*   **Concept:** Render is a unified platform that can host a front-end, a back-end API, and a database all in one place. It's slightly more flexible than Vercel/Netlify if you anticipate needing a more traditional, always-on back-end.
*   **Best For:** Building a system with a dedicated API (e.g., using Node.js or Python) and a managed PostgreSQL database, which would be a significant step up from Google Sheets.
*   **Complexity to Manage:** **Low to Medium.** Still much simpler than IaaS, but requires a bit more configuration to link the different services (web, API, database).
*   **Estimated Cost:**
    *   **Free Tier:** Available for web services, but they "spin down" after inactivity, causing a slow initial load. Not recommended for a production patient-facing app. A free PostgreSQL database is also available for 90 days.
    *   **Paid Plans:** A reliable setup with a "Starter" web service (**$7/month**) and a "Starter" PostgreSQL database (**$7/month**) would cost approximately **$14/month**.

## Option 2: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - The Expert Path

An IaaS provider gives you the raw computing infrastructure (a virtual server), and you are responsible for everything else.

*   **Not Recommended without dedicated, in-house IT expertise.** The responsibility for server security, maintenance, updates, and backups would fall entirely on you.

### Key Providers:

*   **DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS Lightsail, etc.**
*   **Concept:** You rent a virtual private server (VPS) and have full control over it.
*   **Complexity to Manage:** **High.** This requires proficiency in:
    *   Linux server administration via the command line.
    *   Configuring web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
    *   Installing and managing databases (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    *   Implementing security best practices (firewalls, SSH, patching).
    *   Setting up your own deployment workflows.
*   **Estimated Cost:**
    *   A basic VPS starts around **$5-10/month**.
    *   However, a realistic budget for a reliable, managed setup (e.g., with managed databases and backups) would be closer to **$20-40/month**.

## Recommendation Summary

For the next stage of this project's life, evolving to a **PaaS** provider is the most logical and cost-effective choice.

*   **If you want to keep the back-end logic simple (perhaps still leveraging Google Scripts via an API):** Start with **Vercel** or **Netlify**. You can likely stay on their free tiers for a long time.
*   **If you are planning to build a more advanced system with a proper database:** **Render** offers a clear, affordable path to hosting a complete web application for a predictable monthly cost.
