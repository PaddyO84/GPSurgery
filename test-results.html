    <h2>Test Results</h2>
    <p>If your results are satisfactory you will receive a text explaining this. If we need to repeat some tests, make a follow-up appointment or change medications you will receive a call from a doctor or nurse.</p>
    <p>If you receive a message from the Practice requesting you to make an appointment, please donâ€™t worry, as an unsatisfactory result may well just mean that your treatment needs to be changed or some follow up tests arranged.</p>
    <p>In all cases if you do not hear from us in 14 days, please phone for your results.</p>
